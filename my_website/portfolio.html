    <p style="color:green;"> <i> <center> Hello! My name is Nicholas Ortiz and this is my personal paragraph. I am a 17 year old kid born in the United States by a Chilean family. I am taking AP Computer Science with myfriend under a great teacher named Mr. Sibal. One thing I've learned for being alive for 17 years, you don't know what is going to be in that class. I have been in St. Franics for a full four years, and those years have been great. I am wxcited to finish this year with good grades and a pass to go to a good college. </center> </i> </p>
